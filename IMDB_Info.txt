IMDB Info readme file:

This project was made to streamline the file naming portion of a sizable personal media backup project.  Essential, the typical workflow is:
  1) DVDs of a TV show season are copied to a server
  2) The files for the show are all copied to a folder with the naming structure "[SHOWNAME] SEASON [SEASON#]".
  This IMDB naming tool is then run given this folder location
  The tool searches for the show name on IMDB and returns the top 10 results
  The user confirms that the first result is correct (or overwrites the suggested 1st result with a 1-10 selection)
  The tool gets the show's information from IMDB, including episode names
  If the folder being scanned has the same number of files as there are episodes in this season, then the tool will rename each file using the following convention: 
  "SHOWNAME S01E01 [EPISODE NAME]"
   This prevents the user having to manually name the potentially dozens of files that could accompany any given show.
